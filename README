API gaps TeamCity:
 - Reuse ComposideBuildProcess and DelegatingBuildProcess
 - Use XmlXppAbstractParser#parse(InputSream)
 - Consider reusing of Maven build trigger/project models
 - Make server-side PluginDescription contain getPluginRoot() to avoid cast to PluginInfo
 - Add CustomDataStorage to BuildTriggerDescriptor
 - Tools server extension: 
   - no way to provide own UI
   - no way to implement custom downloader
   - user may tweak download url to download malicious file instead of expected one => checkes required
 - Add an API to provide pluginData path without use of ServerPaths class and specifying names explicitly
 - Extract interfaces from jetbrains.buildServer.controllers.admin.projects.EditBuildTypeFormFactory#getOrCreateForm to make it available in open API
 - No Ant Path matcher component to convert relative and absolute patterns to list of files.
 - Option for commandline runner to avoid dumping executing commandline  (I need to hide passwords)
 - Directory scanner may be reused

API gaps NuGet:
 - Allow to call nuget.exe with plugins without installing them into %USERPROFILE%

 - Allow to provide authorization for NuGet sources from commandline
